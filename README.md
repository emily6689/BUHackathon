BUHackathon
===========
A few BU students in the Neuroscience department wanted to scan their endless events emails which were difficult to keep up with and filter them into a nicely organized events calendar. This simple little hack scans through the emails to let you know whether there will be food! And can differentiate between things such as lunch vs light lunch. :)
